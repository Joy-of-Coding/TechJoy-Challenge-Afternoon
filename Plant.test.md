### Test Case 6: Multiple Growth Cycles
**Objective**: Verify complete growth cycle can be repeated after reset

**Steps**:
1. Grow plant from ğŸŒ± to ğŸŒ³
2. Click "Reset Plant" to return to ğŸŒ±
3. Grow plant again through all stages
4. Observe each stage transition

**Expected Result**:
- Plant should progress: ğŸŒ± â†’ ğŸŒ¿ â†’ ğŸŒ³
- Each stage should display correctly
- Reset should work at any stage
- Multiple cycles should work consistently

**Status**: [ ] Pass [ ] Fail
